# Common textual elements

All of the most common HTML5 elements, such as paragraphs, links, bold, small and slanted text, have been styled by default using clean, modern typography to make your pages look cool and stand out from the rest of the internet. The native font stack is used to figure out the best font for each device, setting the background and foreground colors, as well as the size of the text to 16px and its line height to 1.5.

## Example

```html preview
<mici-para>This is a paragraph. with some
  <mici-strong>bold text</mici-strong> and some
  <mici-em>italics text</mici-em>.</mici-para>
<mici-para>
  <mici-link href="#">This is a link.</mici-link>
  <mici-small>This is some small text.</mici-small>
  <mici-sub>Subscript</mici-sub>
  <mici-sup>Superscript</mici-sup>
  <mici-hr></mici-hr>
<mici-para>
```
